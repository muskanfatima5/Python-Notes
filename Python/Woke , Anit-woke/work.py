# What Does “Woke Python” Mean?
# In casual developer slang, "Woke Python" usually refers to inclusive changes in the language, like:

# ✅ 1. Replacing Problematic Terms
# Python has taken steps to replace outdated or potentially offensive terms:

# Old Term	                 New Term	         Why It Changed
# master	                 main	             Avoids slavery-related terminology
# blacklist	                 denylist	         Avoids racial connotation
# whitelist                	 allowlist	         More neutral terminology
# slave (hardware term)	     replica/secondary	 Same reason as above

# 📌 These changes started around 2020 and are supported in tools, libraries, and code style guides (like PEP 8).

# ✅ Sabke liye code likhna chahta hai
# Jaise ek shaadi mein sab guests comfortable ho, waise hi:
# Code clear ho
# Naming understandable ho
# Team inclusive ho (chahe kisi bhi desh, gender, ya background se ho)

# ✅ Respectful aur friendly coding community promote karta hai
# PSF (Python Software Foundation) kehta hai:
# "Hum sab ek community hain. Sabko izzat milegi, aur sab welcome hain."

# # Woke-style variable naming
# user_email = "example@gmail.com"     # Clear, descriptive

# As opposed to:

# # Old, unclear style
# x1 = "example@gmail.com"             # Hard to understand


# 🧱 What is “Anti-Woke Python”?
# Some developers mock or criticize these changes, labeling them as “anti-woke” stances. Here’s what that usually means:

# ❌ 1. Resisting Naming Changes
# Some say:
# “It’s just technical terminology, not racism!”
# They prefer old terms like:
# master/slave
# blacklist/whitelist
# And argue that the change is “needless political correctness.”

# ❌ 2. Focus on Performance Over People
# The "anti-woke" mindset often prioritizes:
# Speed
# Low-level code efficiency
# Raw technical merit
# ...even if the code or community culture becomes less welcoming.

# 💡 Where Does Python Stand Officially?
# Python’s official stance is clear:
# ✅ The language is committed to inclusive naming, community conduct, and welcoming culture.
# PEP 8 and many major libraries (e.g., Django, TensorFlow, Linux kernel) have adopted inclusive language.

# 📌 Why It Matters in Real Life
# Let’s say you’re:
# Working on open-source projects → Inclusive language helps global collaboration.
# Teaching or mentoring → New learners benefit from clear, neutral terms.
# Contributing to companies or teams → You reflect respectful workplace values.

# 🧠 Summary
# Term	                   What It Implies	                                              Real Python Examples
# Woke Python	           Inclusive language, diverse community, people-first code	      main, allowlist, user_name
# Anti-Woke	               Resistance to change, traditional terminology	              master, blacklist
# Python's View	           Supports inclusive, readable, global code	                  Backed by PEPs, PSF, and tools
